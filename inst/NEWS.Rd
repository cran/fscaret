      changed at time when other dependencies were changing the function stopped.
      It was fixed making the predict() fn with try() clause,
      but the resulting generalization error is NA and then in impCalc() it gets
      x100000 less rank than the worst model. Aleksander found another bug related
      models using java (RWeka especially). Also fixed.
